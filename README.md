# Lucidworks Fusion - CVE-2021-44228 ("log4shell-vulnerability") Patch Program
Patch program for Lucidworks Fusion 3.x and 4.x to fix CVE-2021-44228.

This program will apply the remediation change: `{nolookups}` will be added to the logging patterns.

For Fusion versions 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.0, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5, and 4.2.6, it will **also** fully patch the log4j library to 2.15.0 as well.

However, older versions of Fusion are not compatible with this new version of log4j. So we must upgrade to a later version of Fusion 
if you require the library to be replaced completely.
