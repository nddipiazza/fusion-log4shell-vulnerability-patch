# fusion-log4shell-vulnerability-patch
Patch program for Lucidworks Fusion 3.x and 4.x

This program will apply the remediation change: `{nolookups}` will be added to the logging patterns.

For Fusion 4.1.x and 4.2.x, it will fully patch the log4j library to 2.15.0 as well.

However, older versions of Fusion are not compatible with this new version of log4j. So we must upgrade to a later version of Fusion 
if you require the library to be replaced completely.
